# notes-app
It is a simple application developed in angular 6, where users can create,edit, search or delete notes.


Following specifications were kept in mind:

a. UI is responsive.

b. Side-navbar is collapsible, and is opened by default in desktop/tablet view.

c. Timer shows current date-time.

d. As the user types in search box, the notes in sidebar get filtered accordingly.

e. Data is stored in browser's localstorage.



To run the application,
1> Clone this repo.

2> Install node modules with command "npm i".

3> Run using command "ng serve".


PS. To view th icons, you must have internet connection as I've used CDN link for font icons library.
